  The code repository for the <b>new and improved CryptoTracker website</b>, designed for easier navigation and use for those interested in <b>learning about cryptocurrencies</b>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>CryptoTracker</b> is a website that lets you <b>find up-to-date information about different online currencies</b>. It shows you things like the <b>current price, how much all the coins are worth together, how much is being traded, and other important details</b>.
</p>

<p>
  To get this information, the website uses something called the <b>CoinGecko API</b>. Think of it as a <b>source that has lots of information about many different cryptocurrencies</b>. CoinGecko gives us <b>data</b> like the <b>current price</b> and the total value of each <b>currency</b>. By using this, <b>CryptoTracker can give you the latest info on crypto prices and what's happening in the market</b>.
