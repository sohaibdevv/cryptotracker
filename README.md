The code repository for the **new and improved CryptoTracker website**, designed for easier navigation and use for those interested in **learning about cryptocurrencies**.

**CryptoTracker** is a website that lets you **find up-to-date information about different online currencies**. It shows you things like the **current price, how much all the coins are worth together, how much is being traded, and other important details**.

To get this information, the website uses something called the **CoinGecko API**. Think of it as a **source that has lots of information about many different cryptocurrencies**. CoinGecko gives us **data** like the **current price** and the total value of each **currency**. By using this, **CryptoTracker can give you the latest info on crypto prices and what's happening in the market**.
